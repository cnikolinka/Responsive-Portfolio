     <p>My name is Nikolina, I grew up in a small town called Pisz, in a lake infested province in Poland.
            Growing up I had big dreams of becoming a veterinarian one day as I always had a very special place for animals. 
            My family and I migrated to the states in the Fall of 2003. </p>

     <p>I had to learn the language, adapt to the new melting-pot cultural differences, and find new peers. 
            After graduating High School I was nowhere near ready to step into the real world, or to decide what I'd like to study in college. 
            My dreams of becoming a veterinarian were no longer possible due to my immigrational-status conflict. </p>

     <p>I tried my strengths in Dietary Science and then a few years later in Nursing. Life has brought difficulties which forced me to quit school both times.
            While being away from school and supporting myself with my full-time bartending job I knew I needed to gain an education and start a more serious career path.
            Learning to code was a brand new idea, a scary as much as an exciting one. </p>
            
     <p>signed up for the Rutgers bootcamp diving deep into the unknown.
            Even though I begin this journey with absolutely no prior experience. I am confident in my ability to learn and persevere. </p>
